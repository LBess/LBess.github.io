		<!-- Ray Tracer -->
		<h2>Ray Tracer</h2>
		<br>
		<p>
			One of the projects in my computer graphics <a href="http://courses.cs.tamu.edu/sueda/CSCE441/2020S/">class</a> was to create an offline <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_tracing_(graphics)">ray tracer</a> from scratch in C++.
			<br><br>
			This was a difficult yet immensely rewarding project. It was difficult in that I started from scratch and had to learn how light behaves in the real world in order to simulate it accurately.
			One skillset among many you quickly sharpen in computer graphics is math, specifically with regards to linear algebra and vectors. After finally cracking the code of putting
			math and physics into code to simulate light the results were very satisfying.
			<br><br>
			A problem I ran into a lot with the project was having to overhaul big sections of code whenever I needed to add a new feature (shadow rays, triangle intersections, reflection, etc).
			From this I learned that I need to spend more time planning out the program, so that I don't need to refactor large blocks of code repeatedly.
			<br><br>
			Some future improvements I have in mind for this ray tracer are implementing ray-triangle acceleration techniques like a KD-tree, and implementing refraction.

		<!-- Flocking Algorithm -->
		<h2><a href="https://github.com/LBess/flocking-algorithm">Flocking Algorithm in Unity</a></h2>
		<br>
		<p>
			In this project I implemented <a href="https://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/">Craig Reynolds'</a> work on simulating animal flocking behavior. The different colored triangles in the demo represent two different "species"
			of agents, and the white dots in the middle represent obstacles. The agents only flock with members of the same species, and they avoid the obstacles.
			<br><br>

			The flocking behavior is achieved with three simple behaviors calculated by each agent.
			<br>
			<strong>1. Alignment:</strong> Agents are compelled to orient themselves in a similar direction as their neighbors.
			<br>
			<strong>2. Avoidance:</strong> Agents are compelled to move away from nearby agents if they are within a certain threshold.
			<br>
			<strong>3. Cohesion:</strong> Agents are compelled to move towards the midpoint of all nearby agents within a certain threshold.
			<br>
			These behaviors can be weighted differently for different species, thus achieving flocks that move and look differently.
			<br><br>

			In the future I would like to add custom behaviors for predator agents which chase down and eat the normal agents. To complement this, I would also create a new behavior for
			the normal agents to flee from predator agents.

		<!-- Maze Game -->
		<h2><a href="https://github.com/LBess/snake">Classic Snake game in Python</a></h2>
		<br>
		<p>
			For this project I utilized the <a href="https://www.pygame.org/news">Pygame library</a> to create Snake in Python. Unlike a mainstream game engine like Unity, Pygame puts low level operations such as updating
			the screen in the hands of the programmer. Instead of learning a lot of the API calls and overall layout as in Unity, I was instead learning more general methodologies
			used in computer graphics such as how the screen is "drawn" on to achieve movement.
			<br><br>
			To improve on the current game I would like to add a main menu and leaderboard.

		<!-- Cave Runner -->
		<h2><a href="https://github.com/LBess/cave-runner">Maze game in C++</a></h2>
		<br>
		<p>
			The purpose of this project was to both learn <a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/creating-adventure-game-terminal-ncurses">ncurses</a>, a terminal graphics library, and implement a rudimentary game AI. Ncurses has been around in some form or fashion
			since the early 1990s, yet there wasn't much documentation on it besides the main author's website. This necessitated me having to tinker a lot to find out how specific things were done.
			The AI is simply a goblin that chases the player via a Breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. One simple yet interesting thing I learned from this project was how to <a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/212808/treating-a-1d-data-structure-as-2d-grid">map a 2D array to a 1D array</a>.
			<br><br>
			To make the game more interesting I would like to both add more maps and some way for the player to slow down the AI.
