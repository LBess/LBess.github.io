      <description>Leadville First stop in Leadville was a very good pizza place called High Mountain Pies. 10/10, would recommend their &amp;ldquo;Crocodile Pizza&amp;rdquo;.
Mt. Elbert We woke up at 0530 and were on the trail by 0620.
The first part of the hike took us through a fantasy-like aspen forest.
My first 14er, Mt. Elbert! What&amp;rsquo;s nice about this trail is that there wasn&amp;rsquo;t any rock scrambling required. So, although it is a long hike and there is a lot of elevation gain (~5000 ft for us), there&amp;rsquo;s no climbing required.</description>
