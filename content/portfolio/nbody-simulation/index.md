### N-Body Problem
How do we simulate the movement of n-bodies when each body affects every other body?
Examples: Gravitational forces on stars, network visualization, molecular dynamics, and more.

### Naive Simulation
Before attempting the Barnes-Hut simulation I first implemented the much easier Naive n-body simulation. I quickly discovered that the Naive simulation couldn't effectively run simulations with more than ~2000 bodies in real time. This is actually what kindled my interest in pursuing Barnes-Hut; I wanted to see massive galaxies move around in real time! 

#### The Algorithm
For each simulation step
1. Loop through each body and calculate the force from every other body
2. Update the positions and velocities 

### Barnes-Hut Simulation
This is an approximating simulation of the n-body problem.

#### The Algorithm
For each simulation step
1. Build the Octree
2. Compute each nodeâ€™s center of mass
3. Approximate the force on each body by traversing the octree 

#### Octrees
This data structure is the magic behind the Barnes-Hut simulation. It is essentially a normal tree with the caviat that every internal node has eight children. The octree is used for 3D Barnes-Hut because it is both fairly easy to implement and efficient. For 2D Barnes-Hut, a quadtree is used (each internal node has four children).

My implementation has a few additional characteristics
* Each body is a leaf
* Each leaf has a max of one body
* Nodes are cubes, and have the same length as all others nodes on their level
